# Lola-IA: Intelligent Virtual Assistant ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¡

## Overview
Lola-IA is an intelligent virtual assistant powered by Python. Designed to interact with users, 
perform tasks, and provide helpful responses, Lola leverages AI-driven algorithms and natural language 
processing (NLP) to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Processes user inputs for meaningful interactions.
- **Task Automation**: Performs predefined tasks based on user commands.
- **Customizable Responses**: Tailored replies for specific scenarios.
- **Integration Ready**: Easily integrates with APIs and other tools for extended functionalities.
- **Modular Design**: Add new features and skills through plug-ins or scripts.

## Prerequisites

### Tools & Environment
- Python 3.8 or later.
- A virtual environment is recommended for managing dependencies.

### Libraries
Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/josuesmoody/Lola-IA.git
cd Lola-IA
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running Lola-IA
Run the main script to interact with Lola:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Adding Skills
Extend Lola's capabilities by adding new modules in the `skills/` directory. For example, to create a new skill:
1. Add a Python script in the `skills/` folder.
2. Register the skill in the `skills_registry.json` file.

### API Integration
Connect Lola to external APIs by adding integration scripts in the `api_integrations/` directory.

## Example Interaction
After starting Lola, you might interact like this:
```
User: What's the weather like today?
Lola: The current temperature is 22Â°C with clear skies.
```
